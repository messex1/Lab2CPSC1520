				<p>
					Functions are (at their simplest form) collections of statements that may
					be run as a group at a later time. These can be useful as they allow
					developers to reuse code and break larger problems down into simpler ones.

					<span class="note">Note:</span>
					Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, and so can be treated just
					as any other object that you might use.
